# Loop
In Ansible, loops allow you to repeat tasks over a list of items. You can use loops to iterate over variables, files, or anything that needs to be processed multiple times.

Here are some common ways to use loops in Ansible:
## 1. Simple Loop
You can loop over a list of items using the loop keyword.
## 2. Loop with Dictionaries (Key-Value Pairs)
You can loop over a list of dictionaries (key-value pairs) using loop with complex data structures.
## 3. Loop with with_items (Deprecated in Ansible 2.11+)
The with_items syntax is an older method, but still works in earlier versions of Ansible.
## 4. Loop with a Range
You can also loop over a range of numbers.
